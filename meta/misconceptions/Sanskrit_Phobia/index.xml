      <title>Caste system</title>

      <description>Claim: &amp;ldquo;Sanskrit literature reinforces the hindu caste system.&amp;rdquo; Why single out Sanskrit epics for this analysis? What about Hindi, Tamil, Kannada, Telugu epics that also reinforce that system? And some counter-religious bauddha and jaina texts? All ancient scholarship (irrespective of language and country), was to a huge degree, elite scholarship. Why would you turn a blind eye to mountains of Sanskrit works (hindu, buddhist, jain) which talk nothing about caste or gender roles in a way you dislike?</description>

      <description>Some limited decline:  Q15.   Lay use  Despite contrary socio-economic forces, it is vitally alive. For numbers, seethis thread. Just search Youtube for Sanskrit videos - even omitting ancient hymns, you will find a lot. &amp;ldquo;Sanskrit villages&amp;rdquo; -  mattUru 1.     Thriving literary scene and scholarship  200-300 Mahakavyas composed in Sanskrit since independence. Total literary output is much more. I myself am in regular contact - in person and electronically - with a quite a few sanskrit scholars of the very high caliber - even more if you consider second degree contacts.</description>

      <title>Hard language</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/sanskrit/meta/misconceptions/Sanskrit_Phobia/Hard_language/</link>

      <description>Not so - the &amp;ldquo;grammar translation method&amp;rdquo; introduced and imposed by the British, and exposure to only hard registers of sanskrit causes this wrong impression. See this detailed speech. With an immersive approach, conversational Sanskrit is as easy as any other language. Of course, advanced/ masterful usage requires serveral years of dedicated effort - like in any other language. [Funny &amp;ldquo;Hitler learns Sanskrit&amp;rdquo; video.] If the right register (Simple Standard Sanskrit - archive) is used, sanskrit is quite easy for all Indians.</description>

      <description> It is impractical to switch to using sanskrit as the link language of India.  Hebrew example: WP15.    </description>

      <description>Sheldon Pollock&amp;rsquo;s nausea Per his words in this video snippet: TW.
 Per his words in this video snippet: https://twitter.com/pvaal2/status/1301890398407856128
 Also interesting are his views at https://twitter.com/pvaal2/status/1301913079563812866 :
 &amp;ldquo;Inheritors of a past that they did not create themselves have an obligation to share it &amp;hellip; &amp;quot;
 The premise is wrong, of course. I find it very striking that one does not see oneself as an extension of one&amp;rsquo;s forefathers (sagely or otherwise).</description>

      <description>Accusation: You cannot do or teach modern technical subjects (eg. maths, physics, chemistry, biology&amp;hellip;) in sanskrit. False - You can, and it will be quite precise, meaningful and fun. Example of a brief description of titration and stellar chain reactions - MT16(TW16). Chinese, Japanese, Israelis and Germans do science in their own languages. Among them, Hebrew is a revived language. That said, we can still concede that we can expediently use English for such subjects while retaining sanskrit for the soft sciences.</description>

      <description>Sanskrit is not the optimal language to learn in order to earn more money. So, we should ditch it and teach German, Chinese, etc.. [FP]  Earning more money is not the only reason to teach languages to our children. There are very strong humanistic and aesthetic reasons to favor Sanskrit. If we want diversity in the international languages taught to our children, that is welcome - let them compete with English - not Sanskrit.</description>

      <title>Restricted social role</title>

      <guid>https://vishvAsa.github.io/sanskrit/meta/misconceptions/Sanskrit_Phobia/Restricted_social_role/</guid>
      <description>Accusation: Sanskrit is the language of Brahmins, and that too male brahmins. Further, it was only used for shAstra-s and kAvya-s.
  In the past - see note on &amp;ldquo;history&amp;rdquo; above, which indicates clear usage outside ritual.
  There are plenty of Sanskrit scholars (right from upaniShadic seers such as Aitreya mahidAsa to dArA-shikoh / Abdul Rahim Khan) who were not brahmaNa-s or kShatriya-s. Eg: mAtanga-divAkara the chaNDAla [TW].</description>

      <title>Sanskrit suppresses other (Indian) languages</title>

      <description>Some languages have an oppressor - oppressed relationship. Eg: Arabic vs Egyptian. English vs Iniut. Though Sanskrit was a link language across Asia,this was not the case with Sanskrit and other languages. Rather, their relationship was of the nourisher-nourished type. References: Balram Shukla&amp;rsquo;s answer here.  Enrichment of other languages  Sanskrit enriched local languages - with its special ability to coin new words.  A grateful acknowledgement of influence on Thai - YTTh2015.</description>
