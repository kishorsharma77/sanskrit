      <description>General anti-intellectual idiots. Eg. NE16 Anti hindu groups  Various communist groups. Eg. NE16 Various muslim groups. Various Christian groups.   Regionalists who are afraid (without much basis, and shortsightedly) that sanskrit popularization will reduce the influence of their regional language. Certain academics are against popularization of sanskrit - claiming that it will lower language standards and that it is a gimmick (with the actual reason being that it reduces their speciality and value).</description>

      <description>NASA uses Sanskrit.  False. NASA website does not any mention such program.   Sanskrit is the best suited for interacting with a computer. (Originally proposed by Rick Briggs.)  Semantic context-freeness is different from syntactic context-freeness.  Example by suhAsa -&amp;ldquo;मित्रं कलत्रम् अपश्यत्&amp;rdquo; – Did the wife see the friend or did the friend see the wife?   There is some truth to the continued value of the kAraka-analysis of Sanskrit grammar (same concept was presented in this Ted talk).</description>
