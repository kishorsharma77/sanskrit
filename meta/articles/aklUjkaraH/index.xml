      <description>A Different Sociolinguistics for Brahmins, Buddhists and Jains
PROFESSOR ASHOK AKLUJKAR Professor of Sanskrit, Department of Asiun Studies, University of British Columbia
Intro Much writing has been done on the social and political aspects of the selection and use by Brahmins and Sramaņas of Sanskrit, Pāḷi and Prākr̥ta (particularly Ardha-māgadhi). Especially in the last few decades, Professor Madhav M. Deshpande has been very active in this area of research. With great effort and considerable awareness of the complexity of social life, he has tried to reconstruct the history of sociolinguistic relationships between the followers of the three major religions of ancient India.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Sanskrit as a supreme language&amp;rdquo; by Ashok Aklujkar [Arch] is a very pertinent read. Some excerpts follow, with some added formatting. My notes are marked in bold like this: (VV: …). The most important section is the one titled: &amp;ldquo;Emergence of dominance&amp;rdquo;.
History  Languages very close to Sanskrit was spoken by nearly ALL classes of people in the first millennium BC [Q13]. &amp;ldquo;The available evidence, from the earliest Sanskrit plays and other literary works around the time of the Buddha, is that Sanskrit and the early Prakrits were mutually intelligible.</description>
