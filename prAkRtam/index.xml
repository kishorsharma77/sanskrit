      <description>The Dravidian language Tamil retains a large number of old loans from Maharashtri Prakrit, even though its descendent language Marathi does not. This suggests that the prakritic base of other IA languages were overlayed by a secondary layer derived from a later degeneration of Sanskrit. This secondary layer is actually a Pan-Indian phenomenon and could represent the point of normalization of the Pan-Indian Sanskritic elite with respect to the Prakritic masses.</description>
