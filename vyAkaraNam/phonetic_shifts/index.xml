      <description>Tilak&amp;rsquo;s observation I may, however, remark that the process which appears so simple according to the modern philological rules, was not recognized by the native grammarians. There are good many words in Sanskrit which can be thus easily derived on the principle of the insertion and omission of h.+++(5)+++ Thus we have invakā and hinvakā both meaning the stars on the top of Mrigashiras, and aṭṭa and haṭṭa denoting a marketplace.</description>
